"""Module for feature engineering, time-based split, and XGBoost model training.

CONTEXT & PURPOSE:
------------------
This script forms the Machine Learning core of the MLOps pipeline. It reads raw
ingested data from PostgreSQL, constructs temporal and lag features, and trains
an XGBoost regressor to forecast pharmaceutical product demand.

MODEL SELECTION (WHY XGBOOST?):
-------------------------------
1. Tabular Efficiency: Gradient Boosted Decision Trees consistently outperform
   deep learning models on structured tabular time-series data with small to
   medium observation counts.
2. Nonlinear & Seasonal Dynamics: Handles non-linear trends, complex multi-year
   seasonalities (winter flu, spring allergies), and sudden demand spikes without
   requiring strict data stationarity assumptions.
3. Feature Importance & Interpretability: Provides direct insights into key drivers
   (e.g., lag weight vs. stock levels), which is essential for supply chain planning.
4. Robustness to Noise & Outliers: Tree-based partitioning is resilient to delivery
   shocks and temporary supply chain anomalies.

DESIGN & ARCHITECTURE:
----------------------
1. Data-Agnostic Contract:
   The pipeline assumes no specific generator logic. It strictly relies on a
   standard schema (date, product_id, sales_volume, stock_on_hand, etc.), making it
   ready to process real-world client data.

2. Censored Demand Handling:
   To prevent zero-sales during stockouts from skewing lag features, stockout periods
   are masked and forward-filled (demand signal reconstruction).

3. Time-Based Validation:
   Prevents temporal data leakage by splitting train/test sets sequentially along
   the timeline rather than using random cross-validation.
